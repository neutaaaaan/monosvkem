**Monosvkem** trades the all too common angry fruit salad for the subtle hues
of the goopy mess stuck at the bottom of the cement mixer.

Monosvkem only bothers itself with `comments`, `strings`and things that get
linked to the`special` group.

It used to be a dirty hack of
[Iosvkem](https://www.github.com/neutaaaaan/iosvkem) but it has since been
rewritten from scratch to support both dark and light backgrounds.
